`filetype.vim` is an example of how to get **vim** to
recognise a file type. It should be installed in
`~/.vim/`.

With filetype recognition, **vim** can then look up
a syntax file for the type, under `~/.vim/syntax`

**vim** provides help on the topic of filetype
recognition. Try:
```
:help new-filetype
```
